# go-GraphQL

A simple GraphQL API built with Go, designed for learning and experimentation.  
This project demonstrates the basics of GraphQL by modeling a relationship between **Courses** and their **Categories**.

## ðŸ“š Overview

This is a lightweight application using:

- **Go** (Golang)
- **GraphQL**
- A simple in-memory or basic persistence layer

The project serves as a practical example for understanding:

- How to define GraphQL schemas and types in Go
- Querying and mutating data with GraphQL
- Handling relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many between categories and courses)
